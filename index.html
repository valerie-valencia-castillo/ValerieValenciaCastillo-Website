        <div class="subheading mb-5">CollegeCorps Fellow and Pre-Business College Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Valerie Valencia Castillo, and I am a first-generation Latina student from a dedicated immigrant family, who are my drive and inspiration as their exemplarity & wisdom are reflected on accomplishments. Through the obstacles that my parents battled through for my sister & I, crossing borders, facing poverty, battling adversity along with language barriers, and ultimately facing similar obstacles myself, cultural barriers like machismo, similar language barriers and prejudice. Through their encouragement and connection to my community I found outlets in extended education to break stereotypes, pursue my passions & aid my community.
As a Mestiza Latina, I, Valerie, have made it my passion to add to the small numbers that statistics presents to us. This means adding to the 4% of Latinas who have a master’s degree. Furthermore, I aim to inspire other women of color by presenting that we are more than capable of doing so, by providing the representation that I found within Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Through these models I have found the potential and intelligence we hold, and how despite all odds, we can achieve our goals. As a result, I want to pursue a master’s degree, either within psychology or business administration to obtain my goals of becoming an industrial psychologist and beat another odd of only 4% of Latinas that hold high positions in business. By creating an influential platform and presenting my capabilities, I further aim to elevate other women of color growing to be or in the same position to conquer these odds. 
<br><br>

       In the journey of fulfilling this mission, my experience in the current position I hold has influenced and led to my practices of leadership and allowed me to progress my goal. Currently, I hold a fellowship for the College Corps Program at UCR which tasks me with the mission to provide educational support and resources to students along with assisting teachers in the recreational arts. I serve at the Cesar Chavez Community Center, where I consistently tutor students, but I have also had the opportunity to mentor them as well. This experience has allowed me to provide guidance to students from a wide range of backgrounds and ages, aiding them in their goals. From helping a second grader solve a math problem, to helping a high school senior with their resume, providing the knowledge I have attained through my experience to aid the goals of my students has provided me with different ways to approach a variety of their situations. When it comes to tutoring students with their schoolwork, through diligent practice and new teaching techniques, I have been able to aid students in not only knowing how to do their schoolwork but truly learning and understanding their lessons. Furthermore, with the assistance I provide in the recreational art classes, I consistently practice my creativity to bring new, innovative ideas in any kind of practice. 
<br><br>

        Through this connection in my community, I’ve further been able to connect students with role models and representation to further inspire students and encourage excellence to fully embrace their full potential. I wish to continue this goal in future opportunities that await me and apply my current disciplines and experiences to it as well.
